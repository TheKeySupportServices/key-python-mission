# key-python-mission

Python Software Engineer mission repo

## Notes

Given the time constraints of the mission we have included a vanilla Django 3.2 implementation in this repo. Whilst we have provided it in this repo you are by no means forced to use Django for your solution.

Our chosen python package manager is Poetry; but again, you are not limited to this.

Whilst not suitable for production, the base docker image uses the default root user to reduce chance of any permission related complications during the mission
